# Password-manager-
a basic Personal password manager with specific syntax to work around (Python)
for current version
# notes to use:
-change in while loop the master password according to your liking.
-only modes available ("add","edit","view")
-for the first time using this, you need to remove comment """ func """, but dont remove the func in between and run the code once then u have to delete the func that was inbetween the comments
-if u ever need to transfer your data to another device, u have to transfer with key and password txt file
-i will try to implement more security and gui in the future
-enjoy :)
